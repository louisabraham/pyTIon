# pyTIon

Some Python programs to interact with "old" Texas Instrument calculators.

I just love those machines that made me discover programming, and find it
awesome to be able to make them communicate with modern devices.

* `TI83_screenshot.py`: screenshots from a TI83+/TI84+ in realtime


## Install

    sudo pip install --upgrade pyusb
